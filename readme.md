## Getting and Cleaning Data Course
==================================================================

The 'run_analysis.R' script will produce the results for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project.

The script assumes that the contents of the zip file downloaded at 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip' are present in the current directory starting at "UCI HAR Dataset".

The script will pass through the following exercises:
	
**Exercise 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.**

**Exercise 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**

**Exercise 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.**

**Exercise 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.**

**Exercise 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**


The resulting dataset file is 'data.txt'.
